The aim of this repo is to help reproduce bugs that are affecting the development of our application but that seem to be unrelated to our code.

# Initializing the repo

To initialize the repo please run the following commands after cloning:

1. `npm install && npm run build:all`
2. `ng serve --project operations-mobile` --> serve mobile version of the app (**https://localhost:6003**)
3. `ng serve --project operations-web` --> serve the web version of the app (**https://localhost:6004**)

Note that there are two versions of the app in this repo, a mobile version and a web version (both are served on a browser). Some bugs are exclusively observed on one of the two versions - the version on which to reproduce the bug is always specified.
